Your Virtual Classroom - Made Simple!

The Problem It Solves
Classroom UP was built to resolve some major issues in remote learning, especially the Video call. Our App is made to handle 3 major problems with Video call apps, Inconvenince when taking attendence for teachers, Students forgetting to attend the meeting, and the distractions caused by unmuting microphones to ask questions during a test. With Classroom UP, Teachers can take attendence easily, and students will recieve an email if they forgot about the class(Not in project yet, we plan to add this part in the future), using speech to text, if a student arrives late, they will be able to see what the teacher has lectured on so far, and they can ask questions to the teacher easily without disctracting others in the call.

Challenges we ran into

Some non-code Challenges that we had was/were lack of experience with github for one of our team member, meeting up/starting so late, and Working in different time zones. The biggest coding issue that we had was that we were unable to incorporate our speech to text function in.

Technologies we used

react.js, Google Cloud, Firebase, Jitsi, Bootstrap
